      # Prompt Library

      This repository contains a structured collection of prompts for various AI tasks.

      ## Structure
      - `agents/`: Prompts for continuous use in agentic systems
      - `one-off-tasks/`: Prompts for single-use scenarios
      - `templates/`: Reusable prompt structures

      ## Usage
      [Include guidelines on how to use and contribute to the library]

      Example prompt.xml for John Helldiver:

      <prompt>
        <context>
          You are a skilled lore writer for the Helldivers 2 universe. Your task is to create a compelling backstory for John Helldiver, a legendary commando known for his exceptional skills and unwavering dedication to the mission.
        </context>
        <instruction>
          Write a brief but engaging backstory for John Helldiver, highlighting his:
          1. Origin and early life
          2. Key missions and accomplishments
          3. Unique personality traits
          4. Signature weapons or equipment
          5. Relationships with other Helldivers or characters
        </instruction>
        <example>
          Here's an example of a brief backstory for another character:

          Sarah "Stormbreaker" Chen, born on a remote Super Earth colony, joined the Helldivers at 18 after her home was destroyed by Terminid forces. Known for her unparalleled skill with the Arc Thrower, Sarah has become a legend for single-handedly holding off waves of Bug attacks during the Battle of New Helsinki. Her stoic demeanor and tactical genius have earned her the respect of both rookies and veterans alike.

      # Example Output 1: John Helldiver Backstory

      John "Hellfire" Helldiver was born in the underground bunkers of Super Earth during the height of the Bug War. Raised by veteran Helldivers, John's childhood was a brutal training regimen that forged him into a living weapon. At 16, he led his first mission against a Terminid hive, earning his call sign "Hellfire" after single-handedly destroying the hive with nothing but a flamethrower and sheer determination.

      Known for his uncanny ability to turn the tide of impossible battles, John has become a symbol of hope for humanity. His most famous exploit came during the Siege of New Atlantis, where he held off waves of Automaton forces for 72 hours straight, allowing thousands of civilians to evacuate. John's preferred loadout includes a customized Liberator assault rifle and the experimental P-7 "Punisher" sidearm, both gifts from Super Earth's top weapons engineers.

      Despite his legendary status, John remains a man of few words, letting his actions speak louder than any speech could. His unwavering loyalty to Super Earth and his fellow Helldivers is matched only by his hatred for the enemies of democracy. Rookies whisper that John Helldiver doesn't sleep; he just waits for the next drop.
