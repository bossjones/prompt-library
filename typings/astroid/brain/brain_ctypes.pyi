Inside the ctypes module, the value class is defined inside
the C coded module _ctypes.
Thus astroid doesn't know that the value member is a builtin type

    For each ctypes redefined types, overload 'value' and '_type_' members
    definition.

    Overloading 'value' is mandatory otherwise astroid cannot infer the correct type for it.
    Overloading '_type_' is necessary because the class definition made here replaces the original
    one, in which '_type_' member is defined. Luckily those original class definitions are very short
    and contain only the '_type_' member definition.
