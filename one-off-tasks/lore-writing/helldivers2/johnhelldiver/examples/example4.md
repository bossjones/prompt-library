# The Last Stand at Malevelon Creek

The acid rain drummed a steady rhythm against John Helldiver's weathered armor as he crouched behind the remnants of a fallen tree. Through the perpetual mist that gave Malevelon Creek its infamous reputation, the mechanical whir of approaching Automaton forces grew louder. Behind him, three rookie Helldivers scrambled to reach the extraction point, their boots squelching in the thick mud.

"Get to the shuttle," John commanded through gritted teeth, his voice carrying the weight of countless battles. "I'll make sure these toasters don't crash your party."

The distinct red glow of Automaton optical sensors pierced through the rain-soaked canopy. John checked his LAS-16 Sickle's heat sink - nearly spent, but it would have to do. He had already exhausted his supply of orbital strikes keeping the main force at bay.

As the first wave of Automatons emerged from the treeline, John burst from cover, his Sickle cutting precise arcs through the rain. "Come on, you chrome-plated bastards! Today's forecast calls for a 100% chance of DEMOCRACY!"

The laser fire illuminated the misty battlefield in brilliant flashes of blue, each shot finding its mark with devastating precision. Automaton after Automaton fell, their chassis sparking and smoking in the acidic downpour. But for each one that dropped, two more emerged from the fog.

Behind him, he heard the extraction shuttle's engines roar to life. The rookies were almost safe. A stray bullet caught him in the shoulder, but John barely flinched. Instead, he laughed, the sound echoing across the creek bed.

"Is that all you got? I've seen better aim from a malfunctioning coffee maker!"

As his Sickle finally overheated, John drew his trusty P-4 Senator sidearm, the weapon that had seen him through a hundred last stands. The Automatons pressed forward, their cold calculations unable to comprehend the sheer audacity of a single Helldiver holding this position.

The extraction shuttle lifted off just as John's position was about to be overrun. He keyed his radio one last time: "Remember what they say about John Helldiver, rookies - he always delivers!"

With a defiant grin behind his helmet, John pulled out his last thermite charge. The Automatons never saw it coming - they were too busy processing how one man had managed to destroy half their battalion.

Three days later, when the next drop team arrived at those coordinates, they found a clearing littered with destroyed Automaton parts, the ground scarred by laser fire and thermite burns. And in the center, planted barrel-first in the mud, stood a P-4 Senator, still smoking from its last magazine.

They say if you listen carefully on Malevelon Creek, through the sound of acid rain and mechanical warfare, you can still hear John Helldiver's laugh echoing through the mist, challenging any Automaton brave enough to face him.
