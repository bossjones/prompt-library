# The Defense of Outpost 86: A John Helldiver Chronicle

The winds howled across the frozen plains of Valthan IV as John Helldiver stood atop Outpost 86's observation deck, his weathered P-4 Senator holstered at his side. Three days of constant Automaton siege had left the outpost's defenses in shambles, and ammunition was running critically low. Only four Helldivers remained from the original squad of twelve.

"Sir, Bot signatures approaching from the north," reported Private Chen, her hands steady on the station's antiquated scanning equipment. "Multiple Hulks leading the charge."

John's expression remained unchanged behind his steel-gray helmet as he activated the outpost's emergency broadcast. "This is Commander John Helldiver to any Super Earth forces in range. Outpost 86 holds critical intelligence on Automaton manufacturing facilities. We will not abandon this position."

The ground trembled as the first wave of Hulks crashed against the outpost's outer walls. John unholstered his Senator, the worn grip fitting perfectly in his gloved hand. "Remember the five D's," he called out to his remaining squad. "Democracy demands dedication, determination, and discipline. But today, we focus on defense and destruction."

What followed became legend among the Helldivers. For six hours, John orchestrated a masterful defense, using demolished Bot chassis to create chokepoints and transforming the outpost's maintenance bay into a killzone. When ammunition ran dry, he led charges with salvaged Bot weaponry, his tactical genius turning the enemies' own arms against them.

As dawn broke over the frozen wasteland, a relief force finally arrived to find John standing amid mountains of destroyed Automaton forces, his armor scarred but unbroken. The intelligence secured at Outpost 86 would later lead to the liberation of three sectors, but it was John's unwavering resolve that day that truly spread managed democracy.

They say the Automatons still have analytical data from that battle in their archives, and that their tactical protocols were permanently altered to account for what a single Helldiver could achieve when defending democracy itself.
