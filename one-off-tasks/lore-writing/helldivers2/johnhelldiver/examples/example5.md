In the grand mythos of Super Earth, propaganda reels endlessly recite the saga of John Helldiver, the quintessential hero. Stories of him battling relentless waves of automatons at Malevolent Creek—dubbed Robo Vietnam—illustrate a man who was either cunningly real or the fever dream of a soldier-hungry public relations machine. There, amid the cacophony of servos and gunfire, Helldiver became a symbol of unyielding duty, a stoic yet unwitting beacon to every young recruit. On the battlefield, however, reality claws away at the legend. Automatons swarm, their mechanical prowess mocking human fragility. John stands, outright calm in his power armor, embodying an absurdity of brute force. His weapon—a gargantuan rail gun named "Widowmaker"—sings death across the field, an over-the-top testament to Super Earth's relentless militaristic glory. Yet, within this chaos, beneath the cold facade, John wrestles with a gnawing self-awareness. Surrounded by war's relentless grind, he lingers on moments of stark humanity, trading darkly humorous quips with his comrades. "They say I'll dive into anything," he'd chuckle, launching grenades with surreal expertise. "They never mentioned I'd also dive into obsolescence." In the crescendo of Malevolent Creek's battle, John's legendary status becomes both bane and blessing. Automatons encircle him—he's outnumbered and outgunned. Yet, in one breathtaking act, Helldiver vaults atop a towering enemy war mech, his frame silhouetted against a sanguine sky, and tears the machine apart with sheer determination and maddening gallows humor. The automaton's fall echoes his mythic ascension and despite the personal cost, John Helldiver perpetuates a tale as elusive as it is eternal.
