I want to update @cursorrules.xml by merging relevant information from @logic-to-merge.md and @xml_structure_prompts.md  into it while maintaining its xml format. I intend to use it with claude models so I want to make sure i'm using the best practices `eg XML tip: Use tags like <instructions>, <example>, and <formatting> to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.`

try to only enhance the document and do not remove.

Take a second to look at the code base then when you are ready let's try merging the file step by step. If we need to use multiple context windows simply provide what you can and wait for me to type continue. Try not to lose any relevant information but if parts of logic-to-merge.md don't reflect the current codebase then feel free to ignore adding it. Make the changes once you've thought about everything.
